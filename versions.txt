7/12/2012 sigproc v1.77

(2013-2015?) sigproc version N/A
* Asynchronous sound play 
* iFFT fixed

3/5/2016 sigproc v1.80
* WavePath and DataPath are removed (only AuxPath remains)
* CAstSig::SetNewScript has an optional second argument to make the node output available in the calling process.

9/24/2016
* operator $ added: spectrum shifter by Hz.

-- Operations between complex numbers will turn to a real number if imaginary part is all zero. '+' '*' and concatenation of array are done. 
-- function conj() added
-- fft() and ifft() are finalized. Now x is (almost) the same as ifft(fft(x))

* So far, x(11/2) or x(5.5) becomes and x(6), but 
   x(1:11/5) makes only x([1 2 3 4 5]), because aux_colon doesn't do round up the index
This must be consistent, so from now on x(5.5) x(5.8) or x(5.999) will not round up.
***IMPORTANT********
x(20:15.5) makes only x([20 19 18 17 16])
Be careful... increasing and decreasing indices end differently at the end

9/11/2017 (critical bug id'ed and fixed)
while A B end 
did not work if A was an expression --> fixed by using conditional in psycon.y like T_IF
