map<string,CSignals> Tags has been moved from CAstSigEnv to CAstSig why?

From now on, CAstSigEnv has the information applying to ALL scope (i.e., global scope)
Variables specified in Tags have scope attached to them, so not appropriate to be in CAstSigEnv
Each CAstSig has its own Tags 

So, in xcom.cpp (or a main application file), set a variable of CAstSigEnv with a glocal scope, then all CAstSig members have "const" pointer, pEnv
